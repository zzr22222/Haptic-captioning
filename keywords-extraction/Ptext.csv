1,1,"No, but I think that is largely because it's quite weak, rather than the pattern itself. No, not yet. It's quite calming, really. Honestly, because of the white noise, it kind of sounds like a beach, and that's the only thing I can have in my head. I don't really know. It's maybe pulsating. I don't know. Again, it's not massively put me up or down, to be honest. I think if it was a stronger pulse, then maybe. No, but again, I think that's partially more to do with the actual fact that I am here with a friend with white noise. It's not a very distressing situation. Quite pleasant, really. I don't know."
1,2,"I'm not sure I am feeling this one. It doesn't feel like there's as much of a pulse as the last one, maybe. I don't know. I don't know if it's maybe because this one feels maybe more active or something, and I'm not feeling as much in the pulsing, but maybe more just of a general tingling or something. I don't know. I'm not feeling it super strong, so it's hard to say. It's almost like you're petting a cat or something, but a cat with not very long hair. And it was robotic. It's pleasant. I don't know. This one feels a bit more familiar, I would say."
1,3,"See, this one feels a bit stronger. Yes, excited. And yes, I suppose I do feel satisfied. Yes, I mean, the actual sensation of itself is quite nice. And again, it's not super strong. It's really quite pleasing. And it's like when you used to have TVs way back in the day. They would have static on them when you touch the screen. It feels like that, but maybe 10 percent of that. So it feels definitely not natural. It's a technological feeling. I don't know. It's an alien feeling. And so things I felt before is a little bit like the TV thing. I don't know. It kind of feels like you might be away to get a massage or something, and they start you off with this."
1,4,"I'm not really feeling very much from this one, but it's nearly there. I feel like if I get myself into the rhythm, I'll be able to. Not really, because I don't feel enough to actually say one way or another."
1,5,"This one feels quite regular. It's not super, super strong, but you can kind of definitely feel more of a pulse. This reminds me more of the first one. I don't know if that's actually a helpful answer if they're going to be sequenced, whatever. All I can think of is adjectives now, but it's quite direct, and it's quite regular. And I don't feel distressed other than the fact that I can't think of any nouns. This feels more like you have a fancy alarm clock that wakes you up by giving you very gentle vibrations. That's what this feels like to me."
1,6,"This one's very urgent. I can really feel this. The others you're having to think about more. It's not sharp. The best word I can come up with is urgent. This feels like really an alarm. It's like no longer being gently woken up. It's like it's 8:15. Get out of bed, like a fire alarm or something important. And it doesn't feel dissatisfying. I mean, it's like, as I said, I feel like an alarm. This feels like you're actions afoot, whereas some of the other ones have been more like soothing or nice on the finger. But this has also been my favorite of them. No, I don't feel bored. The others have felt more familiar. This feels different. I don't know if it reminds me of something that I have felt before. No, not as much like. The other ones have felt more like this is this sensation. It's somewhere back in my deep brain, whereas this one reminds me of things I've experienced before. I just mentioned alarms or things like that. But it doesn't so much remind me of a tactile sensation."
1,7,"This one is a lot slower. This one feels almost like a heartbeat or something. Yes, it's a heart beating or maybe not a heart. Maybe if you had some sort of system where it was like --. This is so bizarre. It's like a watering system where you have sprinklers that go in regular patterns and put water on people's gardens. It feels a bit like that or something. Yes, it's regular and quite soft. The last one was a bit harsh. It's not soft because it doesn't feel fluffy or anything. It's soft in terms of I can feel the pulse, and it feels more, maybe, indirect. It's like someone else's alarm is going off."
1,8,"This one feels like regular. What's the right word? It's not as intense as some of the other ones because it is slower. So the other ones are a bit more pressing or urgent. This one feels more like it's still quite harsh and quite strong, but it's not as fast. I know I keep going on about alarms. This one feels like an alarm, or something bad is happening, but they want to keep everyone calm. I mean, it feels like a phone ringing, actually. That's what it feels like. It feels not unpleasant. It's quite a nice intensity. Some of the other ones were a bit more like you're struggling to feel it, or else it was very in your face. This one's more pulsating, which is quite pleasant, but the rhythm of it is not nice or not, not nice, but it's quite jarring. But the actual sensation, the tactile sensation, is quite nice."
1,9,"I'm not feeling a whole lot on this one. I don't know if that's because I'm not in the zone. Though, I can feel that it's quite rhythmic. It's not very sharp. It's more soft and more constant and not flowing. Dominance to me is like an oppression thing, and it doesn't feel particularly oppressive. But it also doesn't feel submissive. It's maybe a slightly unnerving thing, really. I don't know. No, it feels quite novel. The only thing it feels a little bit like is when your downstairs neighbor has their washing machine on, and the vibrations are coming up to the floor. But you can't necessarily hear or feel the actual rhythm of it. It's more just the constancy or something. I don't know. Indirect, almost."
1,10,[empty]
1,11,"I'm not feeling a whole lot from this one, to be honest. There's one of the other ones that I said that for. It feels similar. It's like there's something, but I am just not quite getting it."
1,12,"This one feels like a train or a horse. Excitement is not necessarily the first word I'd be like --. I feel excited, but it's not relaxing particularly. It feels like you're jogging or something. Yes, it's quite rhythmic, I would say. It's quite pulsating, quite up-beat or urgent or whatever. But it doesn't feel alarming to me anyway."
1,13,"So the last one felt like a horse. This feels like a train, I think. Yes, it's quite nice. It's quite settling and almost soothing or something. Yes, it's like you're on a train or something. So it's not passive or the waves rolling in, and there is a rhythm to it. The last one was quite direct. This one feels less involved or something. I don't know. Yes, I feel satisfied. This one definitely feels positive, like if you were playing a game or something and you had a remote controller. I'm not a gamer. Do they not do, when stressful bits are happening, the remote shakes a lot? This feels like you're doing well in your game, that good things are --. Or you're not in any danger."
1,14,"This one feels quite strong. This one honestly feels like shaving a little bit, like you're using an electric razor. Just the actual vibrations on my hand feel a little bit like that. This is quite constant. There is a pulse, but there are no gaps, if that makes sense. It's more steady. The fact that it is quite fast does make you feel urgent. I feel like I'm moving my finger faster. It almost feels a little bit like you're at a club, but the techno is very hard and fast. And it's just like not noise, but it's not necessarily rhythmic. I don't know. Yes, but that's just because of the pace. The actual sensation is quite pleasing and nice and soft, a little bit like shaving. With the techno thing, what I meant by that was the tempo of the pulse a little bit more. The pulse that I am feeling anyway is quite fast, almost like a heavy bass line. But it's not like when you're listening to hard techno like [onomatopoeia]. It's not like rhythmic or like constant, whereas this feels rhythmic and constant, but it's just also fast. I don't know. It's not relaxing and maybe slightly stressful, but it feels nice though. It's maybe a little bit like you're coming towards the end of giving a presentation, and it's going well so far. You're like, we're nearly out of the woods, but you're still in quite a high-pressure situation. It doesn't feel not nice, but it also is not relaxing."
1,15,"This one feels like you have your hand on the printer, one of those big printers we have at work. And it also has the big scanner, and the copier and all that. It's shooting out pages like it's nobody's business. I don't know. You're printing a 200-page thing. And it's really in its rhythm. It is just shooting them out. I don't know. The description I just gave sounds like a boring task, but it's quite pleasing to me. I don't know. Yes, I feel satisfied. It's like mundane or more menial tasks like me doing laundry, for example. I feel like it fills me with --. It's not boredom. It's, I guess, satisfaction, but it's not an excitement either. It's quite rhythmic. It's quite fast. But the last one that I described as shaving that was fast in a way felt like you needed to keep up. This feels like fast the way that you're in a taxi or something. It's not you driving. This is happening, and you're a passenger in that sensation. I don't know. I'm watching these pages shoot out. I don't need to catch them. They're falling into the tray."
1,16,"I am not feeling a whole lot from this one if anything. Maybe if I slow it down. Yes, this one's nice and slow. I don't feel this one as strong as I feel a lot of the other ones. I don't know. A little bit more bored than the other ones. I think that's the tempo of it, maybe. And the fact that it is not an aggressive pulse to me. No, I don't feel distressed, really. Maybe bored is a good word. It's not bored in the sense that it's unpleasant, but it's just a bit more --. I don't know. I know I have been talking about printers, but maybe a personal printer from the early 2000s. It would take four minutes to print a sheet. I mean you have to be there for really quite a long time, and it is a little boring. I don't know. Nothing more direct. It doesn't feel like you're seeing an alarm or hearing an alarm or like whatever. It's more just like background noise or a background sensation. I don't know. I think it's funny. I'm equating all of these noises. But I think that's how it feels."
2,1,"It reminds me of something creaky, like a seesaw or something. It also feels like when you run your fingers down a knife-edge as well. No, I don't feel excited. I guess I would just describe it to someone else, as I said before, like when you run your finger down a blunt knife, like a kitchen knife, and that has got a rugged edge. No, it doesn't feel dominant. It feels quite neutral, I would say. I associate it with sawing something. I would say it feels slightly uncomfortable."
2,2,"I would say it feels quite similar to the last one. I would associate it with when you hold a balloon and then you put your arm down it. No, not your arm, your hand down the balloon and feel the, what's the word --. God, I don't remember the word. I don't really associate any adjectives with it. It just feels squeaky on my finger. It also makes my hand feel numb as well. It makes me feel slightly distressed, actually, more than the last one. I don't feel satisfied, no."
2,3,"It's interchangeable. I think it feels like you're waiting for something to happen because it's going smooth and then hits the glass because there's nothing really happening with the vibration. So it's just your finger on the glass. It does remind me of something, actually. It reminds me of the fingerprint button on an iPhone. That's what it is. It's quiet. I would say it feels quite quiet."
2,4,"I would say it's quite similar to the last one when I said it felt like the fingerprint button on an iPhone. It feels like when you unlock an iPhone with your fingerprint but maybe five times stronger than that, to be specific. It's maybe like an alarm clock. I wouldn't say it reminds me of something I felt before."
2,5,"Yes, it feels quite smooth, like putting your finger in water. I don't feel excited. I would say it's boring. Yes, this doesn't really feel like much is happening with this one. No, I don't feel distressed. I do feel slightly satisfied. No, it doesn't feel dominant."
2,6,"This one feels even smoother than the last one. Really random, but the first thing that comes to my mind is icing sugar, like when you hang your hand in it, and it feels really soft. It feels like when you use a nice pen, like a smooth pen. Other than smooth? It's nice, I guess."
2,7,"I don't really like this one. It feels a bit scratchy. It feels like rubber, like putting on rubber boots or wearing something rubbery, touching something rubbery. It makes me feel uncomfortable, I would say. No, I don't feel excited. I feel slightly distressed. I don't feel satisfied."
2,8,"I feel like this reminds me of something, but I can't think what it is. It feels a little bit like before, like rubbing a balloon but on a lesser scale. It feels familiar, but I can't put my finger on exactly what is. I think it feels tiring, I would say."
2,9,"Again, this one feels quite similar to the ones before. It makes me feel quite agitated because it's smooth, and then you can feel stronger vibrations, I think, but you don't know when they're coming. It actually feels a little bit like chalk on a blackboard kind of thing. I would say it's unpredictable. Yes, I would say it makes me feel a little bit nervous. No, it doesn't remind me of anything I felt before."
2,10,"Yes, this one feels a lot stronger. It feels like you're getting an electric shock. It's like, I don't know if you have it in Germany that game, what's it called? It's like the little man on the operating table. And then you have to put the organs into him using the little tools. And then it gets a shock if you hit his body. No, I don't feel satisfied. Yes, it probably makes me feel more excited than the other ones so far. Yes, it does feel dominant."
2,11,"This one feels like or reminds me of a heart beating. I don't know if it does remind me of something. I would say it's quite consistent, quite rhythmic, and quite calming. I would say it sounds like a clock. I would say it feels quite smooth on my finger. I would describe this to someone else as having constant but subtle vibrations under your finger."
2,12,"This makes me feel like I'm in Ved Siden Af. Literally, the first thing that came to my mind was being in a nightclub. It's quite frantic, intense, a little bit scary. It feels like a bomb that is going to explode or something. It feels really strong on my finger. Yes, it feels like when your skin is pulsing, maybe a bit sore or something."
2,13,"This one feels like I'm using a pencil. I hate using pencils. I've already used the word scratchy, but it also is quite scratchy. It's not very nice. It feels like when you run your finger along a smooth surface, but maybe like a wooden surface. But then there's a bit of wood sticking up, and then it's like a splint, just like that. It just feels uncomfortable, I think."
2,14,"This one feels like dramatic music in a movie. It's like a bad bit in a movie. Someone is being chased or something. It feels like it goes from low to high on a loop. It reminds me of those lights that you get in science museums, and it's like a globe. And there's a light and then when you touch it the light comes to your finger and then you can move the light. It feels like that. I don't know."
2,15,"This one is like a frog croaking. It feels scary, actually. Because the vibrations are quite low, and they get faster. It feels like your fingers are being chased. I don't know if it does remind me of anything from before. It is quite intense, quite dominating, quite rough as well."
2,16,"I do not like this one. And it feels like sandpaper. And it feels quite frustrating. It feels like you want to wear it down to make it smooth, but then you can't. So it's quite annoying. It feels like I said, like sandpaper, just like holding a bit of paper or a bit of cardboard."
3,1,"It makes me feel a bit annoyed, actually. And it makes me feel like I'm more sweaty than I think I am. I'm sticking. Slightly irritating. The sensation feels like my finger is wet. I think this is the best way to describe it. It reminds me of running my fingers on the window of a car that's slightly damp, like a mirror, a damp mirror. It's like you're trying to do or describe it as like you're trying to do something, but you can't. It's sticky, but not sticky. That's really bad, sorry."
3,2,"It's a little bit happy, not happy-happy, but I don't feel depressed or anything. It feels quite benign. I keep thinking of braille, but, I mean, I have very limited knowledge of what you can use this tech for, I think. It doesn't really remind me of anything I felt before. I don't think, not in terms of anything electric or anything. Tingly. It's like a tingly buzzing."
3,3,"The first word that comes to mind is staccato, which is like a musical term, but it feels like a staccato. I don't feel anxious, but it gives me more of an anxious feeling than the previous one. This doesn't feel benign. I don't think I felt anything like this before. I'm not quite sure how it feels."
3,4,"Just constant friction. It feels very constant. Difficult. Resistance. I think, emotionally, I feel the same way as I would if I were facing restrictions. It's a little bit irksome. No, I can't associate any actions with it."
3,5,"I would describe this to someone else as more discreet. I think you almost have to be attentive to realize it's there. And then it's suddenly more periodical, I guess. It doesn't feel like much on my finger. It's like a small buzz, but it doesn't feel like an obstruction in the same way that the other ones did. It makes me think of when you pull a sticker off something, and there is a tiny bit of glue left, still, even though you got rid of most of it. You wrap your hand across it, and you stick. It's just a little bit annoying."
3,6,"So it feels a little bit stronger, more like a little zing on your finger. I am blanking on adjectives. I think I would also describe this as staccato, a fast staccato buzz on your finger. It's not very imaginative. I'm not really feeling any emotions."
3,7,"This feels like there's a lot more resistance all of a sudden, like jagged. It's a little bit irksome. I don't know. It's annoying. It feels a bit frustrating because it comes and goes, and then it is really resistant all of a sudden, and you don't expect it to be. It's like help. Where did that come from? It's a bit annoying. It makes me think a little bit of like walking through snow on grass. And you don't know what's underneath. And suddenly you step in a hole, and you're like, fuck, was this hole a minute ago, and then you're stumbling."
3,8,"This one feels a bit like the sticker, but there's way more sticky stuff left on your CD. This is also nice when you leave it for a while, like a little buzz. Maybe it makes me think a little bit like polishing something to the point where it gets really squeaky clean. And it always wants to hear that squeaking noise from it. Maybe because it feels like there's slightly more resistance, but it's still quite constant."
3,9,"This feels very constant but more like sludgy. I keep thinking, is it my finger that is sweaty? Or is it the thing that is just there all the time? It's annoying me a little bit, but I think it's maybe because I can't quite sense what I am supposed to be sensing. I feel it can't make its mind up, and I can't make my mind up. It doesn't feel like much on my finger."
3,10,"This feels super resistant to me. This feels quite forceful. This one is a little bit aggressive. Sporadically. No, I don't associate much with it. I don't think I really felt it before. This feels a bit like being stuck in the mud or something."
3,11,"This makes me think of a motor, a tiny little motor. It's slightly buzzing but more powerful. It's just like a buzz. It's like I would imagine a bee would feel like if it just sat on my finger buzzing. Excitement, maybe, is an emotion in a cutesy way. I don't think I feel satisfied. I feel like this would be before the satisfaction. This doesn't feel dominant to me. It feels like a little dog that's barking, and it thinks it's really dangerous, but it's actually really cute. It can feel like that."
3,12,"This feels a little bit more intrusive again. I feel like we're back to the slightly more aggressive ones in a way like it feels a little bit more aggressive. I keep thinking of the sticker again. The sticker stuff, it feels like that. It feels like I expect to take my finger off, and there would be something on my finger that was in the way. It doesn't feel painful or annoying or anything. It's just like there's some kind of obstruction."
3,13,"It's like a vibrator, but one that's not very powerful, just very low level. It's funny to me. It's slightly exciting as well, not necessarily sexually exciting, but like that buzz of excitement. No, I don't feel bored. I feel very in my head, exciting, mysterious, a little bit anxious."
3,14,"I'm so sorry, I'm thinking of a vibrator again, but the ones that come with different vibration patterns because the switch is so dramatic. It feels very dramatic this one. Other than a vibrator? An engine again, maybe. Something slightly unstable. I don't think my finger feels all that much. I think I'd describe it as touching an engine that's sputtering right in the beginning. I think you need to think of an old-school engine that's just coming to life. And it doesn't like that. I feel a bit like that. That felt a bit different. Very jaggy. Spiky. Not very comfortable. It makes me feel a little anxious."
3,15,"This is the toughest when you send it to the max level, the vibrator. Sorry for the audio. It makes me think a little bit of standing on the deck of a ferry when it starts moving, and you're surprised by how much you feel the vibration. I feel a little bit distressed. Yes, it feels a bit dominant. It's taking over a little bit. So it's more difficult to think because it's stressing me out."
3,16,"This one feels so gentle compared to the last ones. You're almost not sure it's there. This feels very friendly by comparison to the other ones, much less stressful. It feels more kind, gentle. I feel that this is like the purring kitten of them. I wouldn't be anxious to have to feel the sensation again. It feels more chill. I would recommend this feeling for other people, but not necessarily the previous ones to experience. I think, emotionally, compared to the other ones, I'm a little bit relieved when I feel this one. Yes, maybe a relief."
4,1,"Okay. It feels a little static, like when you rub a balloon on your head, and then you put it against the --. Yes, exactly when you rub a balloon on your head, and you put it on the wall. That exact kind of static is what I feel. Yes, it's prickly, but not in a sharp way. I feel a lot of small like [onomatopoeia] as if there was a bunch of bamboo woods sticking out, little ones. I was just putting my finger around it. Yes, like tiny little things that I slightly catch on, but not really on my finger slightly catches on to."
4,2,"Okay. It's like a surface that isn't completely smooth, like a wall that's been painted over. It's not quite sandpaper, but you can tell that there is something between you and the smooth surface. Yes, it's how I imagine that wall would feel. Yes, it's some kind of wall or painted furniture, maybe even a chalkboard, something like that. I don't know if the sensation gives me emotions. I don't particularly like it just because it makes me feel like if I scratch at it, it will make a sound. Or I might get something on my nails. But doing this doesn't make me feel any emotions."
4,3,"Okay. So you know how last time I said it was like a chalkboard. This is like a whiteboard that I'm trying to erase or like a window that I'm trying to clean. It makes me feel a little bit frustrated because I feel like it should be smoother in some parts than others. I feel like my fingers are just being caught on some dirt or something when it should be really smooth. It's smooth, but your finger feels like it's being tugged by something small. I don't know. Maybe it's some kind of oil or grease or dirt. Yes, it really just feels like something's dragging on it, like some sort of tiny little thing, like a speck of dirt."
4,4,"I was wondering if this is the one that somebody said sort of feels like farts. I don't know. It doesn't really feel like a fart, but I can feel like something's going on like [onomatopoeia]. It's similar to the last one. But it's a bit more resistance. And I can feel actual specks of dirt. I feel like this glass is dirty. It sort of feels like cleaning a whiteboard, cleaning a window, or at least, what it should feel like when I should have to clean it or something. Gross. I don't know. It's not really gross, but it feels dirty. Sticky. I feel like there are specific parts. Right here, it feels a little bit dirtier than other parts. Maybe that's just me going crazy."
4,5,"Yes, it feels like little vibrations, but I don't know how to describe it. It's like [onomatopoeia]. It feels like tiny little bristles like very, very small ones that I'm running my finger down, maybe sort of like a toothbrush. It still feels a little bit dirty in some places. I'm wondering if that's just me. It's like a lot of bumps that are soft. They're kind of hard. But they're very, very thin and it's a lot of them. It feels like you're lightly touching a toothbrush like the bristles. I don't know. I don't mind it. It feels fun to touch."
4,6,"I can feel vibrating. I don't know. It feels like maybe a wooden surface like that amount of friction. It feels like if I have a good speed, I can easily run it around. But when I go a little bit slower, it's harder. I feel a bit more friction, like the feeling of me passing through it. I'd say it's not as smooth as glass, but relatively smooth. Yes, it feels like a surface, like if I were on a table or something. It feels like my dinner table."
4,7,"Okay. The other one was very uniform. This doesn't feel so uniform. It feels like there are some parts where I'm feeling something and where my finger gets caught. It feels dirty again. It feels like glass. It feels like last time, my fingers getting sort of stuck at some point. If I am rubbing, my finger goes flying through. But then, at some point, it feels like I'm getting stuck on something. I don't like it. I don't know. I feel yucky. I feel like I should go wash my hands."
4,8,"All right. This one's smooth. I feel some friction. Still, I'm trying to think. It's quite small. I can't tell if it feels like a different surface or if it feels like there's some stuff on it. Maybe it just feels a little dusty. Yes, but I'm trying to figure out what it would be. I feel this sensation more when I go this way, like diagonally. I'm not sure if that's me going crazy. I'm trying to figure out what it could be. I feel like a lot of things feel like cleaning a window somehow, but it feels like those windshield wipers. I feel like that's the sound my finger would be making on this."
4,9,"I can only feel it sometimes. So I'm trying to figure out what it is based on. Sometimes my finger feels it. Yes, it's relatively smooth. Yes, I guess it would feel sort of like this table, like an IKEA desk table, I think. It feels like there's a slight amount of friction. Sometimes I feel more than other times. I'm not sure if that's just me pressing too hard. I guess it's neutral. I mean, I'm not entirely certain because sometimes I feel something, but for the most part, it feels fresh and clean relative to the other feelings, but not as much as glass would feel."
4,10,"It's like a light rumbling, sort of like a tummy growling like a stomach growling a bit or like your hands on your dog or your cat or something. I don't know. I like it. It doesn't feel fuzzy as in fur, but fuzzy as in like [onomatopoeia] sort of like petting a bee. Yes, it's buzzy, I guess. Yes, it's a vibration. It's like rumbling a little bit under my touch."
4,11,"This sort of feels like glass, but the first thing that came to my mind was a shaver. I don't know why. Yes, it sort of feels like I'm shaving something, mowing something down. I feel like a shaver or electric toothbrush, but you don't normally feel that with your finger. It's just that sort of sensation that I get from it in terms of something that I have felt before with my finger. I don't know. I am still feeling glass, so it still feels relatively smooth. I don't know. I don't feel hairs, but I feel like I'm pushing something away, but I don't feel what it is."
4,12,"Okay. This again feels dirty, like not super sticky. I don't know. It sort of feels like my finger is getting dragged by something. I don't like it. I feel like some kind of friction. This one sort of feels like it's pushing me a little bit. The other one sort of felt like I was touching a kid's iPad that had spilled juice on it. This sort of feels a little bit like it's pushing back at me, and I don't know why. Okay, it feels like there's a bunch of stuff on it, and when you pass your finger by it, it's blowing at you. I don't know."
4,13,"This one is a very mechanical vibration, like a machine that's running. Yes, this is how it would feel to maybe touch my computer when it's on the actual PC computer. I can feel it rumbling on the inside, but it doesn't feel like there's something on the surface so much. It just feels like it's rumbling from within. I guess it kind of tingles. It kind of tingles on my finger, yes. It's not super rumbly. It's just like a little tingle of something running underneath. I don't know. I feel like it would be something that would be warm because it feels like a machine. But I can imagine if something randomly started making this, I would be concerned if it wasn't what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting it to be a running machine, I guess."
4,14,"It feels like I'm just getting lightly shocked, like [onomatopoeia]. Yes. Okay. It's not as strong, but it reminds me of an electric fence. I've been shocked by an electric fence, and that's quite strong. This isn't so strong. This has an electric current running through it. Yes, I can't associate anything, but it just feels like I'm working with --. Maybe if you're playing laser tag, this sort of feels like what it is like to shoot somebody or to be shot. You get a little rumble that there's a pass of electricity. It doesn't hurt. It's not scary. It feels like I felt something. It feels quite neutral."
4,15,"This is quite smooth, still. The first thing that came to my mind was an ice rink after some people had been skating on it for a while. It's relatively smooth, but you can feel that there's some friction there sometimes. Some people have messed up the ice a little bit. If I think very closely about it, I can feel like there's some vibration on it that I sometimes feel more than other times. It's quite a light vibration that I feel. It's like a small little like snow ice pieces. That's what I feel like. It feels kind of smooth but also soft."
4,16,"It feels like a sensation that I'd feel in some sort of arcade game where something's coming up at me. I'm going to go slower. Yes, it feels like there's some pulsing underneath my finger, but I can't attach it concretely to anything. It feels like one of those spaceship games where it's shooting at you, and then you need to avoid the missiles and shoot back. I'm a little stressed. Not very stressed. It just feels like something's coming up at me, and I don't know what."
5,1,"Yes, it's this small friction. It feels very fast, but also, it just feels like touching something with friction. I don't really get any signals out of it or feel like it wants me to do something. It's just like a small vibration in my finger. Yes, it makes it a bit more difficult. I don't know if it reminds me of something I felt before. Maybe it's the kind of feeling when I've just peeled an orange. And I get this slight friction on my skin because of the juices of the orange. I can get friction from that. And I feel like it's in that area. I don't feel much different with this. It's just there, but I don't really feel like it changes my mood or anything like that."
5,2,"This feels like a bit more friction than the last one. It's more like some plastic that has small dots on it or small rivets or something like that. I can feel it. And it's like this steady, constant thing. Emotionally, I don't really have a response to it, but I can feel like it's working against me or trying to make me slow down maybe a little bit but physically. It's more difficult to actually move my finger because there's this resistance. If I should describe it to someone else, I would say, like running a finger on the side of a matchbox, so some nimble small dots are running over my skin. And it feels a bit like physically stopping me in my tracks. I think that's what I get from it."
5,3,"This feels soft in a way. It doesn't really have that much of a texture. Maybe if I'm really concentrating on it, it feels more like lines more than it feels like dots. It doesn't really bring attention to itself. It's just there. I wouldn't be able to tell if it was just the surface that was like this or if there was something else. It feels more discreet and more hidden in a way. I would say it's soft, runny. I think maybe a bit cool, not cold, but like a bit of coolness or something like that. Yes, I think it reminds me of skiing somehow."
5,4,"It's more sporadic. It feels like it's stopping me more. It feels like it's telling me to stop. I'm pushing, and something is pushing back. I'm trying to get somewhere, but there is a force exerted in the other direction. And it's more like in waves, like not constant. It's trying to tell me to stop and not just be in the way, but actually trying to tell me something like, don't go this way. I feel some kind of stubbornness. I get to feel more stubborn and more want to push against it. It feels like there's something with a thought behind this, but it wants me to do something."
5,5,"It feels very draggy. Yes, I'm thinking of dragging. It's holding me back, but this is not pushing me. This is more pulling me. It's more of a pulling emotion. It also feels like trying to run away from someone who is holding you back. Someone is having their arms around your waist or something, and you try to get away from them. I feel like that's the feeling that I get from this. I'm getting pulled towards something. It feels not rough, but I don't feel that much, I think. When I run my finger over this, I can imagine the sound of it squeaking, like when you rub a glass or something with some water on it. That's what I'm trying to play music with, a glass. That's the sound I'm feeling."
5,6,"I don't know. Ice cream, I think, is the first thing that comes to my mind. I think it's a bit soft. I want to say comforting, but it's not really comforting. It might feel more like a touch. Right now, I feel it a bit more like pointy. It comes more in waves or in small outbursts. Jumpy and a bit pushy. Yes, my finger jumping like it's going, and then it's stopping and going and stopping in a way. I would say I think the adjective is jumpy or barrier or something like that."
5,7,"Yes, this feels like an electric pulse, like a small electric outlet. It feels a little bit tingly. I don't know. It feels like something I felt before, but I can't really place where it is. It feels electrical. No, I don't think I can associate any actions with this. I don't know. I'm thinking of some therapeutic stuff or maybe a massage or something like that, like sitting in a massage chair or something like that."
5,8,"Yes, it feels very periodic. It wants to tell me something. It feels like an alert of something like a very small alarm clock. The sensation is also electrical or a bit pointy but very periodic. So it feels like an alarm clock. The sound that I get in my head is an alarm clock going off in the morning telling me to wake up. Yes, I feel like it tells me to be alert or to be aware of something. It's more like danger ahead or something. It feels like it's telling me to stop doing something. I should put my attention towards something important."
5,9,"Yes, this feels very insisting. It feels like it's telling me to stop, but it feels pushy in a way. It's really trying to tell me something. It also feels very physical, I would say. It feels like an object. It doesn't feel electrical, like some of the others. But it feels more like a surface that I'm used to. It's again that I feel like I need to be aware of something. I think it's more that it feels like it wants me to stop moving my finger more than it wants me to be aware of something. I find this more relating to the thing that I'm doing now. I can imagine driving a car and then having a feeling like this in the whole car telling me to slow down, like slow down or stop what you're doing right now. It's not being alert of anything else."
5,10,"This feels like quite a lot of friction. It also feels tingly, as if an electrical current is running through me. It feels like a weak electrical fence or something like that. You can feel the tingling. I don't really feel like it's trying to tell me anything. It feels very constant. It feels like it's there all the time. It doesn't really evoke any feelings. It's just there. I don't really think that it reminds me of anything. It should be an electric fence or something like that, but a very small voltage. I don't know. Maybe a bit of excitement. That is not an action. Or doing something that you have to gather up the courage to do, I would say. But it's not a specific action that I could do. But I think I'm just relating it to the electrical fence. I think that's the main action that I'm feeling or associating it with."
5,11,"The first thing I was thinking was an electrical saw, not a saw machine, but the round ones, a round saw spinning around. And then I get this pulsating. It's almost like a heartbeat or something like that or like a pulse you can feel on someone. I would say it's electrical. And then there are these small shocks. Yes, there are these things that bring attention to themselves. I don't know what they're trying to tell me. It feels like communication, but I don't know what it wants to communicate."
5,12,"Yes, it feels like the sound of going over a glass, but not making music on it, but more like washing your windows or something like that. It feels like a squeaky noise. And I can feel it's pulsating. But it doesn't really communicate to me, or it doesn't feel like communication. It feels more like a part of the surface or something that's just there when I'm running my fingers over it. I would say it's like when you are cleaning your kitchen, and you run the cloth over a dirty area where it stops in its tracks but then continues going on. Yes, I would say cleaning the kitchen counter."
5,13,"There's not really anything that comes to my mind, actually. Maybe, I don't know, spitting. I think that's the first coherent thing that came into my mind. I get a picture of yellow or purple or something like that. I don't know. It feels like color. I don't know why. It reminds me of something, but I don't really know what it reminds me of. I have this unclear picture of some plastic looking like jigsaw puzzles with some colors on them. But I don't know what it is. Maybe a feeling of some playset when I was a kid. I think that's what's coming to my mind. I had this playset where you could have these infrared lights, and you could set up this alarm system. Somehow that reminds me of this, like playing with electrical things as a child."
5,14,"I would say it's periodic. It comes in waves. It feels like it's trying to stop me, but it doesn't feel like it's succeeding. It's saying stop, stop, stop, stop, but not really putting effort into it. So it's half-hearted messaging that it feels like. I don't really think I can put any adjectives to it. It feels like a fence. It's strong. It's emphatic. I'm sure that it's there, and it's insisting, but not in a way that succeeds with it. It's insisting, but also not really trying or not giving it all."
5,15,"I'm thinking of jets in a jacuzzi or a spa or something like that, like these small water --. Yes, it feels like water pushing out on me of these small water jets used for massaging. That's the feeling I'm getting from this, like calmness and relaxation, I would say. It's feeling relaxed. I would say going to the swimming pool or going to a spa or something, something leisurely, but something relaxing. I'm not exercising, but I'm relaxing in the water. I think that's what I'm really doing. Maybe going into the sauna after that."
5,16,"This one is really annoying, I think. It's really holding me back. It's in the way. It's biking across cobblestone. I don't know. It's not like it's stopping me, but it's really an inconvenience, like really saying, slow down, take it easy, stop, at least tone down what you're doing. I feel like I want to get away from this sensation. I don't want it to get worse. So I want to slow down at least until I can get away from this. It doesn't feel electrical. It feels very physical, very much like a hard surface, like a real everything. It feels very forceful. It's a lot of force. It's feeling like my finger is skipping over stuff. It's running over stuff. I'm just jumping up and down. It feels like the most friction yet. And it's just making my finger jump up and down."
6,1,"This one feels like it's really hard to actually move it. There's some friction, like little hills. I don't know if I can explain that. Maybe a good way to explain it is like it feels like the glass is getting stuck on my finger, like the little parts, like making a fingerprint. It's uncomfortable. Maybe it feels like there's something on the glass. Someone has spilled something. Yes, it feels like when you spill something in the kitchen and then it's a bit sticky and you try to wipe it away with your finger, and then everything gets nasty. So it's nasty. It makes you feel nasty. It's like something wants my finger to get stuck on the glass. And it probably is going to make a really gross sound if I would hear it."
6,2,"Somehow, this one feels even worse in some cases, especially when you slide your finger up. If I could hear it right now, I think it's gonna make a creaking sound. It feels like there's a bit of vibration when I move it faster, a bit like electricity balls in those science centers. But it also makes me want to put all my fingers there. Yes, electrical buzzing. So it's maybe a sound a bee makes or a beehive. If I would have to put a sound again to this one, for instance, it's maybe like a motor running. It's not good."
6,3,"This one is like it has the same motor running, like what I said, like this kind of electrical feel, but it's more smooth. I feel like maybe if I were playing a game on glass or like a touchscreen, then this one would show that something has been done like a goal has been reached. It's not a nasty buzz like the last ones. It feels like I'm doing something. If I look right at my hands, I would imagine maybe I'm drawing with a paintbrush, a  rusty paintbrush. It's not in a bad way. It gives a sense of accomplishment, maybe. It's exactly that. You have a brush at the top of your finger, and you're brushing something away, or you're painting a picture if I would move it faster. Yes, I guess that's a good explanation. It's like a little brush on my fingers."
6,4,"Okay, this one is like the hum, what I was talking about before. It feels slower, more of a deeper voice if there would be a voice. It's not as pleasant as the last one. And it makes me feel like there is something wrong. If I had to put it as an adjective or in a story, then it would be dark in some way. So it gives negative feelings, but not in an irritating way like the first two, but more sinister. Or again, you're playing a game, and something bad happens. Yes, it's lower. If this was music, it would probably be bass or something."
6,5,"Yes, okay. This one feels like you're running, and you stumble upon all the hills in your way. I think there's something that stops the movement, like intervals. At least it feels like it. It looks like an application is lagging. So it's not nice. It makes you pissed off. Irritating. It's probably someone very neurotic or prompt or impulsive behavior. I don't know. I guess exactly like computer lag. It makes you impatient. Come on, do something properly now."
6,6,"Okay, so this one is smooth, and then it hits a tiny bit of weight. I don't know. It reminds me of the sea or a very calm sea. I am not really sure because it doesn't really remind me of anything else I've experienced before in a touchscreen, especially. It feels dormant, like something is not right, or it's starting up. It's passive, to be honest. I don't know. A shaver that doesn't work. It feels like it confuses my finger because it's not really still, but it's also not really constantly buzzing or sending this vibration. So I think my finger is really confused. It's not something I would want to feel, actually. I think."
6,7,"Yes, this one is really disruptive, again, because there are these longer intervals of just nothing. So it feels like I can do whatever I want, and then something just kind of grabs a finger. So it feels very restrictive and not in a good way. I mean, restrictive is not in a good way. It's annoying, oppressing. So it holds you back. It doesn't slide your finger. You expect a very smooth slide, but it disrupts that. I could imagine it would be used for something that tries to slow you down. Yes, because it gives this phase-like feel. I can imagine you're hurrying somewhere. And then somebody is like, no, don't go. It pulls you back from your clothes or something."
6,8,"It's passive, quiet. I don't know. I don't like this kind of people. It's like someone who lives with their five cats because it's a very low and annoying little buzz in the background. It was kind of hard for me to first even detect it and not even detect it. But I couldn't really understand if it was the buzz or my finger against the glass. Yes, it's telling me it's very coarse. It feels grainy. I'm sliding my finger across some small grains. Yes, I don't know. I've dropped salt, and for some reason, I'm doing eights in that with my finger."
6,9,"This one feels barely noticeable. I couldn't understand at first that there was some kind of a pattern. It feels like it's just my finger on something sticky or grease. I don't know. Sweat on it or something. It's a bit disruptive. I don't know what to even say about this one. It's not something you would meet, like using a touchscreen in real life, I think. I guess maybe it has this lagging as well. So like when you're at the McDonald's that have these touchscreens, and sometimes they don't work because stupid kids use them too much. And then it's you ordering. That's how it feels. Impatient. Those got damn kids. I just want my burger. But something is not right. I expect smooth sailing."
6,10,"This feels low again, like something in the background. I'm touching a tiny motor, but it's not too vibrating. But it also, maybe, reminds you of pain. If it's tooth pain, it's something in the background. It feels like it's just aching or vibrating. I think it's someone very stable, actually someone who is so confident and maybe like a leader. Yes, it's like a stable, confident person. I already said stable, continuous, in a way calming, maybe because it doesn't change. It's just going to continue until you turn it off."
6,11,"If I was talking about something sticky before, then this one feels even more. I was thinking for a second that there was something on my finger. Yes, it looks like I've taken jam, poured it on my counter, and now I'm just playing around with it. Yes, this is not a good feeling at all. Yes. Sticky. Glimmered. I think it's even oppressive. I can't move my finger properly. It's literally stopping it. It's not actually stopping, but it really feels like you just put something sticky here right now and there on the glass. It's telling me I should clean the glass. I don't know. If this was like an application of the touchscreen, and I would feel this, I would probably make a restart. It obviously signifies that something is not correct."
6,12,"This one feels alive. It's good to touch, but you can still feel there is some kind of action happening with whatever I'm interacting with. It's not disruptive. It's not too much in your face, but it gives you enough feedback to understand that you're actually interacting with something. It's a positive thing. Maybe success because it does make you feel like something is happening. Something is working. So it doesn't give you negative feelings that there's an error or there's a lack, or something is wrong like some of the previous ones. But I think it's because it's also continuous and not so much disruptive as a feeling. So it's like a positive one. I think it reminds me of kitchen appliances like any kind of appliances that use batteries or a hairdryer, maybe a mixer, even though a mixer is actually a way more strong vibration. But I think it's like when you hold it in your hand, then you cringe, then the vibration becomes less, and it resembles this one maybe."
6,13,"This one, I guess, is some of the sticky ones. It actually doesn't feel as restricting as the one that was more or had a pattern. It's because I guess it takes you by surprise, and then it gives you this false idea that everything is nice, and then it suddenly has this [onomatopoeia] that stops your finger. It doesn't feel good. So it's a bit startling. It makes you feel tricked because, as I said, it gives a good feeling everything works. Then suddenly, it's sticky. It reminds you of boundaries, but I know it's in my head, so if I were playing with a box or something physical. When this disruption happens, it feels like I'm hitting something physical with my finger. So maybe even though I know, it happens at random places, but since I'm drawing actual shapes with my finger right now and this tends to happen at certain points. It maybe gives this 3-D imagery."
6,14,"That one actually feels good, a bit, for example, like a purring cat. But it also feels like I'm actually doing an action like moving my finger. It actually gives some kind of results. I'm drawing some shapes. It's a good feeling. It doesn't feel like a disruption. I think it's because it's prolonged. I don't see that as a person at all. I see it more like I'm doing art, more of an action. If I had to describe it may be fun, creative. But that's because right now, it gives in my head this imagery of I'm doing art. And I'm making this fun collage or a painting or something. So it might be biased. Purring. Fun. Creative. Colorful. Yes, fun. This is fun. It actually feels nice."
6,15,"This one feels like a machine that is pumping out something. So it has a steady purring or steady hum. And then there are sudden weird outbursts, but you can't really explain. Yes, it feels like I'm interrupting something. But it's a machine at work. I shouldn't be touching it. I don't feel like I'm doing anything with my finger here. So it feels like I'm interrupting some kind of process. It doesn't give me any kind of feeling of control at all. As I said, I don't know, a machine pumping out packages like in the Amazon workplace or something like that. They come out of the line. I don't know. This one is a strange one. It doesn't really seem to have any kind of consistency of movement. It doesn't feel like I know the rest of them. No matter how I move my finger, it also doesn't matter. But this one just feels completely off. The one I said there was more drawing at least gave an illusion that I'm doing something, but this one is nothing."
6,16,"Okay, talking about doing nothing, this one also feels that I'm having some impact. It's just like if there were little hills that are kind of hairy, and I'm brushing above them. I'm searching for them with my finger. It almost feels like I could trace some kind of pattern or some kind of landscape. There's actually nothing there. Or if the glass would have different textures, this would give a different texture like hair or something. I think of an old grandma or grandpa, the one who sits in his chair and reads newspapers, just complaining about TV or radio or something. It's loving and nice. Or a cat that purrs, maybe, but a nice cat, not the one who attacks you. I feel alive, maybe. I know I said cat and grandma, but I meant more like nature-wise of like different patterns and different landscapes and materials and textures. And if I wouldn't see the glass or not look at it, I would imagine that there would be whole ornaments of stuff and a landscape of different colors and textures and stuff. It's telling me there's something I can't see. But I can discover that this was a game for kids or something, or you can touch somebody else, a blind person. I would be touching someone's face or something."
7,1,"So this feels very turgid. It feels very slimy and thick. I can feel my hands are sweaty, but the surface is also very resistant, more resistant than a surface can be. And there's a slight sensation of pulsing, not major. It's telling me you're not welcome. It tells me that I'm in a hard zone that I'm stuck in the mud. Frustrated. Slow. Sludgy."
7,2,"It's undulating. I can sense something trailing behind me. There's a primary fuzz, and then it trails behind and somehow. It feels like a few different points of contact were sparkles of it. So it's slightly sparkly, a bit like the crackling of sparks. Mystical. With some depth. A charming guy. Deep voice. Wonder, I think, is something. Deep thought. Introspection. Slowness. Calm."
7,3,"It feels a bit similar to the others. It has that slight sweaty feel but much lighter and much thinner. It feels like a small string of droplets, a very tiny string of droplets. Drumming my fingers. The pecking of a small bird. A millipede marching around, a really tiny millipede. Maybe erotic excitement, like that shiver that you get in excitement. Buzzy. Anxious. Light. Indeterminate. Flattery."
7,4,"This feels somehow like deeper below my fingers, I guess, going deeper. This sensation feels like it's in the glass a bit further. It has a strange rhythm to it. It's almost like a heartbeat of some sort. There's the buzz, and then there is some kind of app below. [onomatopoeia]. It feels a bit like the sound of a base outside of a club where you can feel it on these surfaces around you because it has the melodic aspect to it, like a sense of complexity, which sounds like it's been produced by a human. It's some kind of variance to it."
7,5,"This feels like lots of small balls. There's just a lot of balls falling, small balls falling. It reminds me of a lottery where you have little balls running around. And then they all fall down towards the end. I guess a sense of falling. It could be a joyous occasion of sorts, like a party. You're at a party. The champagne is flowing. People are chatting. There's a bubbliness in the air. It just feels like lots of smooth surfaces intermittently making contact with my finger, just like [onomatopoeia], a bit like those metal pin things which you put in your face and you can make your face --. Imagine all those pins just randomly come into contact with your finger."
7,6,"This sounds like a marching band drummer and a paradiddle. I think it's called where you go [onomatopoeia]. It feels a bit fun. It obviously has a rhythmic component to it, which is peculiar. It's funny. A posh chap who is a bit silly and a bit flippant. He floats around and says lots of little nothings and keeps people entertained in that way."
7,7,"This one is like a straight-up dagger. It makes me think of these dagger waves, sawtooth, whatever, chainsaw. It's just constant and angular. Quick, fast-paced, but not aggressive. Being wired. You've had caffeine, but you don't have any natural energy. You're just like [onomatopoeia]. It's not unpleasant. It's not attached to what I would say is an anxious feeling, but it is like this feeling of artificial energy. It feels somewhat warm. It feels like when I put pink noise at night for me to relax, to go to bed, of sorts, but I still have some energy."
7,8,"This one is almost melodic. It feels similar to the paradiddle one where you can sense it has a very particular rhythm like [onomatopoeia]. It's more meditative and a bit deeper than the paradiddle one. It feels a bit thicker and a bit more like there is ambiance to it. It made me think of being at a club with house music, and it has that more kind of deep house, maybe. There's this kind of ambiance and this warmth to it. It's the same rhythm that goes around and around and around. It feels less dispersed than the other ones. It feels like it's one surface which is making contact. It's like everything which my finger is touching is receiving the sensation rather than like lots of different points. And it feels more like a larger body."
7,9,"This is a very obvious pulsing rhythm, which makes me think of an alarm like the alarms that were in Metal Gear Solid, like a factory-wide alarm by some security system over a big industrial plant. I wouldn't say it's aggressive like that, but it has that length and that dispersion, which makes me think of that, but it's milder. Insistent. Ebbing. Broad. Spacious. It's telling me to take note of something. It's something I should pay attention to, but nothing that's necessarily dangerous or alarming, but of importance to the sense of a better foreboding maybe."
7,10,"This sounds really chirpy, like birds frolicking around in a nervous fashion and playing with each other because they have too much energy. They need to get rid of, come off with. Incessant. Nerves, in a positive sense, like excitement, but also laced with that nervousness of something energy that needs to be discharged. It reminds me of being a kid. I'm playing around with other children and being excited by them, but also a little bit afraid but just like with too much energy to spare."
7,11,"This one was harder to understand. There's a sweatiness and slight pulsing. It feels like a really big ragtag ball rolling over yourself. And it doesn't seem to be that much consistency. It feels many-sided. I thought of some sort of rolling animal, and I was thinking of it. I forgot what cartoon it was, but there is this ant-eater-type looking thing with a long snout, which would roll itself in and roll around spaces. But generally big, fat, with lots of strange angles and subsections."
7,12,"It feels brittle. It feels like a material which doesn't have much substance to it, which feels like glass. It can fracture in many ways but also is quite fine and complexly shaped, fragile. I am stepping on eggshells. I have to be careful here. Stepping on ice. Touching something delicate."
7,13,"This feels like buzzing, similar to the other sawtooth. It feels a bit faster and less deep, more shallow. Constant background noise. Someone with a work ethic, which just goes and does things and has this consistency to their action. And there is low-level determination without drama. It's that running, but not running in the moment, that running over many days and just the action of incorporating running into your life. And so, if you were to imagine doing it for a few months and as a committed action."
7,14,"So this is also pulses. The immediate impression is like a submarine. It feels a bit underwater, a bit gloopy, a bit muffled. It sounds a bit like bubbles. It sounds like I'm hearing medium-sized, manmade metallic structures passing through the water. Ambivalence, but not particularly angst provoking ambivalence but just like ambivalence that's bordering on indifference."
7,15,"This one's very hard to distinguish. It's like my fingers are sweaty, but maybe there's more buzziness when I do it. It doesn't feel like there's any current. For the other ones, I could feel a specific current. But this just feels like sweaty glass but met with rattling more when I slide across. Yes, it's almost ticklish. A bit confused. Maybe a bit frustrated."
7,16,"Tanker. Is this the same one? Again, it feels very similar to just having very sweaty fingers on a pane of glass. It's hard to notice anything very specific about whether there is a current. Now. That's interesting. That makes me think furry. It makes me think I'm handling a hamster. Small and furry. And it's very mild-tempered, curled up in itself. And it's vibrating in an anxious but charming manner. Coziness. Warmth. Sanctuary. Safety."
8,1,"So it feels like very steady, little beats, almost like playing ping pong with a tiny little ball. But it feels like a bit of a delay kind of beat, like it doesn't feel like it's a very fast tempo matching like any speed I'm at. It's just like a slow, drawn-out little beat. I think it makes me feel energetic because it's a bit jumpy, bouncy. And it's a very exciting, positive kind of beat. Playing ping pong. I don't know why. It feels good because it's not a constant kind of vibration. It's up and down, up and down, so it makes me feel a bit more engaged with the glass and the screen."
8,2,"This is a very gentle beat. It's probably the hardest I've, from the warm-up, experienced beyond distinguishing between the friction of the glass and my finger. It's almost something I have to concentrate on to be able to feel properly. It's a very constant sensation. I can almost forget about it if I just keep my finger on the glass for too long, forget that it is there. Bland. Boring. Not very interesting. I  don't really get much out of this sensation, so I think it makes me less invested. And if it was a person, it would probably be someone I wouldn't be interested in talking to. It's almost like being at the beach and just running my hands through the sand if the sand was a bit colder. It doesn't have any rhythm to it, so I think that's why."
8,3,"This is a soft vibration, but it's got a beat to it, so it's more fun. I'm spinning on a DJ set. Yes, disco. I think jamming a jam, like a jam session. It feels really gentle, soft, but also really energetic, or not energetic, like soft, gentle but connected. So just relax, chill out, have a good time, almost like being in a bodega with a good group of friends, and the music's not too heavy, but you know you're having fun. It's just like a really feel-good kind of music and environment. And it's not really a consistent beat, which probably made me think of being more social."
8,4,"I don't really like this feeling. It's a bit haphazard. It's almost like a siren, but it's really soft. It's almost like a warning kind of feeling for some reason. I don't know why, but it makes me feel like there's danger coming. It's ominous but not something I can say I felt before, maybe just like feelings I am getting from watching movies and being in a barrack or something. I feel it could be this [onomatopoeia]. Footsteps are coming. Ominous. Suspenseful. Thrilling. Danger is encroaching. Haphazardous. Slippery. It's gripping and then slipping. I think that's why it's making me feel a bit uncomfortable."
8,5,"This is interesting because it's like a small, slight vibration, and then you got a big vibration. It reminds me of my vibrator, so I would say sexual. But maybe interesting because I'm sure there's a pattern to that big vibration, but it almost feels like it's not because you get lost between the small one. And then the big one. So exciting. It makes me want to keep putting my finger across the screen. Exciting. Interesting. Evoking."
8,6,"I can't really figure out what's going on with this one. There's something, and then it stops. Okay, there's a pattern. It's like a steady beat, and then it stops and then starts again, which is a bit irritating because I can feel like I'm getting into the pattern, and then it stops, and then I've lost the sensation, and then it starts again. Irritated. I'm anticipating something, and then I don't get it. Yes, it's a bit drawn out. I don't know if you can say all this. It is a setting on the vibrator that is really irritating because it makes you climax, and then it stops. Yes. Not consistent. But it is, but it's not. I don't know."
8,7,"That's weird. It's almost really impossible to tell if --. It's almost like running your finger along something, and it is getting caught like a very rough surface. It makes me feel like it's more the surface rather than the vibration. I think it's telling me something's broken. I don't know. I'm really struggling to figure out the pattern in this. It feels like it's almost like when there is the vibration or feeling, it shouldn't be there. This is kind of strange and peculiar. I think it's maybe when you are daydreaming, and you're just doing things mindlessly. It's the kind of feeling where you get lost in that sensation of your finger to the glass. And then you get that vibration. And then you're like, I'm not focusing. I'm not concentrating and then maybe confused."
8,8,"This is cool. I like this one. This is very interactive, like skipping, going for a walk, like an excited mood, like hopping alone. I don't literally hop when I'm excited and go for walks. I would feel it's something that it reminds me of. Do you remember being a kid and you had those xylophones? It's like a xylophone kind of sensation, really light up-beat. Really interactive. Really playful. Groovy and fun. I'm speaking between the glass, like there's something behind the glass, like someone's communicating through the glass, actually. I don't know."
8,9,"It almost feels like this sensation is based on the amount of pressure I'm putting on this glass, but I know it's probably not. It almost feels like it's me and not the signal. I'm like in control. I don't know. It feels like it's coming from me because I can't really figure out a pattern or anything. So it messes with my head thinking that if I press harder, I'm going to feel something more. But I'm not. But I am. I don't know. Maybe unsettled. Because I feel like it's me doing something, but it's not me doing something. So I feel like I've lost control when I said the feeling was making me feel in control. But at the end, I'm just feeling insecure about what is happening. At the Science Museum, there's those things with the purple electric lights, and then you come closer to it, and then you can feel it, and then you move away, and you can't feel it. But it's almost with a delayed reaction. That's why I think those sensations are coming from me."
8,10,"This is quite light, fluffy, almost like running my hands on a dog or something fluffy. It makes me feel quite comforting. Soft. Furry. Cushiony. Not velvety per se, but it's quite light. Comforting and sweet and cuddly. Giving my dog a hug. Petting my dog while she's cuddling next to me. It's almost like a little heartbeat of an animal where you just feel it. I don't know."
8,11,"This is like a heartbeat. This is literally like a heartbeat. It's almost like I'm lying next to someone, and their heart's beating. It's making me feel freaked out. If I close my eyes, I could be putting my hand on someone's chest rather than it's actually glass. So I am a bit shocked but astounded. Yes, just leaving next to someone, rubbing my hand on their chest, and you can feel their heartbeat. I'm feeling close to someone."
8,12,"This one feels like I'm putting my hands through something not quite as light as water, but something a bit more vicious and just put on my hands through slime. I feel rubbery slime, that kind of bounce back, but also liquid sensation. I'm not sure if I'm really getting a message out of it. It's almost more just the sensation if I was to be playing a game. It'll be more like a fun, playful kind of interaction."
8,13,"It's like skating, like ice skating, and when you like to slide along the ice, it's like [onomatopoeia]. Quite nice. Quite like gliding. And relaxing. I think because it's such a long sensation in beat, it's making me feel really calm. Really empathetic because it's almost like the glass is listening to me and being patient with me. I'm just feeling it out. So I would say the person would be a person I would want to talk to and talk deeply with."
8,14,"This is a little bit more electric. Maybe a bit anxious, just because it's a bit more of an electric feeling. The gaps between the sensation are further apart. So it's making me feel a bit almost like the sensation shouldn't be there on the glass, but it is. And it's almost like I touched it, and it's a bit electric, and that's weird."
8,15,"This is quite fun because it's a very constant beat, and it makes me want to keep touching the glass. I could almost think that there would be music playing. If somebody told me that I'm deaf and I'm listening to a song, I'd be like. I know this song. I could tell you what the song is. It makes me feel familiar with this beat. Up-beat. Connected. Having fun. It's very exciting and stimulating, and evolving. I would say stimulating is what I think of the most. Or bringing back to the sensation of like if you were at a party and then you're feeling the vibration of a speaker, and you're just like, this gets me going. This gets me in the mood to party."
8,16,"I don't know if I'm saying this because I am still on that party vibe. It's more like being against a speaker and hearing the beat of a song but not as upbeat. It's more like when you are at a concert, and there's an in-between act, and it's so silent, and they're just playing that music while nothing is happening, but they just want something to be playing. Ominous or shady. I'm not sure if I could really trust them. They're constantly being a bit hooded and not that open and a bit keeping to themselves. Maybe a bit like threatened and wary."
9,1,"Honestly, nothing. I'm just gliding my finger across the screen. It's just like a normal window. It's kind of squeaky, a little bit. No, it's really just like a windowpane, I guess. Maybe I have really hard fingertips. I don't know."
9,2,"Okay, I can feel something now, I think. It's very subtle, though. It's not really vigorous. It's quite calming, I guess. Very loose. It's just like indents. Yes, indents in the glass. It's not very alarming. It's just subtle."
9,3,"This one is less rhythmic, I think. Erratic."
9,4,"Not anything in particular. Maybe uneasy because my finger isn't that smoothly gliding. So it's unpredictable, maybe. Yes, it's more an alarming thing. I guess if this was to be on some sort of computer, maybe it would be telling me not to do something or that something wasn't available to me. Like this thing that you're trying to do can't be accessed."
9,5,"This one is more soothing, more relaxing, more tender. It's not as violent or as assertive. Just smooth and soft and almost comforting, maybe, but present. It's going to fall asleep, but it's holding me in a weird way. I have no idea. To be calm, I guess."
9,6,"This one is a bit rougher, like dragging my hand through sandpaper. Yes, it's like with the other one where if I were to use this on some sort of software, it would be telling me not to do something. Posh. Abrasive. Black and white."
9,7,"Okay. It's not as obvious. Yes, this is the vibrator one. This is the one that is the vibrator. Yes, because it's subtle, but there is a motor inside of it. And in my head, there is a vibrator. Cool. I don't know what it's telling me. I guess I'm just thinking about vibrators now. I don't know what a vibrator would tell me. Pleasure, I guess. Getting off. Sensual sensuality."
9,8,"This is like the last one, a bit but not as aggressive. You are sliding your sweaty hand across a windowpane, and because you're sweating, it's getting stuck. And it creates a vibration. Carelessness, freeing, because there isn't that much. I can't really detect that much of a pattern vibrationally. So it's letting me do its own thing. It's letting me do my own thing."
9,9,"This one is weak as well. Okay, wait. Yes, it's not intentional. I feel like it's really subtle, maybe. If it was a season, it would be winter. I don't know if that makes any sense because it's wispy and delicate and light. It's not telling me to do anything, but it's suggesting. Crisp. It's just tender. Tender. That's a good way to describe it. Tender. And just trivial and novel. It's not urgent. It's just kissing my fingers. It's not nudging it in a certain direction. And the contact it has with the fingers is not that much. It goes away instantly. But it's tiny bits of them. It's not as aggressive."
9,10,"I don't know. Again, it's not as urgent or aggressive. I feel like I'm touching on the surface of a machine, and you can feel the machinery working within it. You're not touching it directly, but it's more on the surface. If I was to be stroking maybe the outside of a car, and you can feel the engine in it. And you're just touching the surface of it. That's what I could imagine, what it would feel like to feel the outside of a car. So I guess I've done that."
9,11,"This one is a bit more smooth. You're gliding your fingers across ice. When you press harder than there is some sort of resistance. Maybe being restricted. Being limited because you can't really just slide your fingers across it without any resistance. There is always the harder you push, but it depends on how much pressure you put on it, I guess. Smooth. Gliding. Subtle."
9,12,"Okay, this one's a bit more peppy. Yes, this is telling me something. This is like my alarm going off in the morning. Peppy. I don't know if that's an adjective. Excitable. I guess erratic, but also energetic, but also worried and anxious because it's all happening. There's a lot of vibrations. Alarmed."
9,13,"This one is a bit like the last one. It just feels like panic, like a heart palpitation or something. Okay, now I'm getting more into it. I mean, it makes me feel alert and aware. I guess I'm doing a lot of work moving around. I guess, panic a bit. It just feels like spiraling into dread because it's quite subtle. The actual sensation is quite subtle, but the more I glide my fingers across the glass, the more I feel. So it reminds me of just overthinking, maybe."
9,14,Okay. This has a beat. This has a tempo. Maybe quite vigilant because it feels like an alarm because it's at a steady tempo. So I guess it's someone I would characterize him as being quite organized maybe but also quite fear-mongering. Alert. Aware. Awake.
9,15,"Okay. This one is more chirpy. It's like a little bird just chirping away. Again, it's like the alarm, but a more emergency alarm. It reminds me of a fire alarm, like panic, I guess. It's good. I'm not complaining. It's not like it's giving me a panic right now, but I feel like it in itself is trying to tell me something that I should be aware of."
9,16,"It's not obvious. I guess it's dragging my fingers through tar because it's quite slow. Yes, it's inconsistent. If I was to do this, then it would be like, this is a hard thing for me to do. I don't know. I'm kind of working against the current, if that makes sense. Prickly. Tricky. Yes, I'm just negotiating. Someone who is set in their waves wears black and white, stubborn."
10,1,"It's a pleasant feeling, but it has these little abrupt stops in the pattern. Yes, compared to some of the other sensations I had in the training, I would say this feels more as if you would have slightly sweaty fingers and you were touching on a piece of glass. So this is more akin to that feeling, though not completely the same, but it feels like that. So at times, I feel like it can be a little difficult to distinguish between whether it's actually the glass or if it's the sensation. I don't know because I would say maybe it's too subtle to really grab my attention. I would say. Now I'm just thinking aloud. So let's say it was a notification or something that tried to catch my attention, then I would feel like it was a little bit underwhelming, but maybe for other things, it might work better. It feels okay. I will say again. In the vibration patterns going up and down, as I said before, it feels they're these small, little abrupt stops between the oscillation, which again feels like it's a super subtle feeling. But yet still, it has this edginess to it or this sharp stop edginess to it. It's the best way I can describe it."
10,2,"I would say this one here is a little bit harder to feel. I would say it feels like a rugged, uneven surface, almost like if you were to touch something like a brick wall or something, something that's just a little uneven. I would describe it as a person, that is. I don't know. I guess I would at least describe it as a person who would not have smooth skin. I don't know what kind of connotations that would bring up. I don't know."
10,3,"This one here feels like it has a little bit more pattern to it. It's almost rhythmic in a sense. Yes, I would say, for instance, music. For instance, that could be a chord progression or a baseline of something, something that has sort of a rhythm to it that changes. It feels good. I would say it sort of speaks to my brain the same way that hearing a chord progression or a bass line or something like that in music will do, like something that you can follow along to. Yes, that same area of the brain being activated, almost."
10,4,"This one here feels a bit harsher. I would say it's more warning. If I were to compare this to another modality like sound, for instance, I would say, if you do something on the computer and you are unsuccessful in your action, you will get a sound or something that kind of communicates something went wrong instead of some, I don't know, rising pitch sound. This is more like something didn't go as you would have expected it to go. I don't know. Unsuccessfulness. Try again feeling, if that makes any sense."
10,5,"I would say maybe a little bit it reminds me of some of the actions that my Apple Watch does. So again, in comparison to some music sounds where you might have something that goes up in pitch or down in pitch to signify something, the Apple Watch does the same thing with vibration, where it will go up in vibration pitch and down in vibration pitch to communicate something. This feels like it's coming in these waves of vibration in the same way but more monotone. Yes, it feels like these waves or a surge of vibration that comes on and off and like an on-off pattern. So something that signifies something that is a binary state. It's there, or either it's not there. On-off. No, I can't come up with any adjectives."
10,6,"I would say this one here is more coarse, especially in relation to the other one. It sort of feels like the vibration pattern is more spread out than the other one was. Again, I would say I like this coarse feeling. But what I think where you could really harness the strength of this feeling would maybe be in combination with something like the one previous to this one. You could, instead of having this coarse vibration pattern, then have something that moves from coarse to more fine-grained over time interval to communicate change more or less. If I had to put an adjective on this one here, I would say static. Not in a bad way, but it's just a static feeling of some coarse vibration pattern."
10,7,"Sharpness. More needles stabbing. It's like this prickly sensation if your hairs start to rise in the back of your neck, sort of feeling, I would say. I don't know. Getting kissed in the back of the neck or something. I don't know. It's like this weird space between pleasure and pain. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's a clearly nice or pleasant feeling, but yet still, it's very distinct. I'm not going to say it's painful or anything because it's not, but it's just very stabby. I don't know. It causes arousal in some way."
10,8,"I would say maybe just to describe what I'm feeling also. This feels like longer bursts of vibrations. And to me, what it sort of signifies is, I don't know, something that's activated or something that's ongoing or in live progress. That's what it's telling me. I would characterize it as someone who is, I wouldn't say, hard-working, necessarily, but someone who is sticking to their guns and doing what they're told. They will get up every morning and do their thing and do what they're supposed to do."
10,9,"It's very subtle. It almost feels like it's pulsing. Maybe it's just the way that I touch it. It's like some of the other ones. I don't know why I keep returning to this word stabby, but it's just the sensation of it being. The attack of the sound is quite hard, and it's decaying quite fast. So it comes on really quickly, and it leaves really quickly. So it's not like the sine wave. It's not really like a slow beat, but it's very up and down."
10,10,"This one here is more pronounced than the other one. I would say this here is one of the more attention-grabbing ones that I've felt so far. I would assume that it would be able to take or catch my attention more easily than some of the other ones. And I think one of the reasons why that is is because it feels like there is more spacing between the vibrations as opposed to some of the other ones where it's it's a really, really sudden sound, sorry, a really, really subtle vibration. The frequency of them coming on is also very close together that it can just mud together almost where here I'm actually truly able to feel each and every vibration very clearly. It makes me feel like this is something that I need to look towards, or this is something that I need to pay attention to, like this is something of importance."
10,11,"So this one here is quite similar to the other one, just with even more spacing. And I would say it's in the same vein as the other one. There is a lot of the same things that hold true to this one here. I would say, however, that because the vibration pattern is spread out to this degree, it might feel maybe a little too sporadic. Yes, I would say maybe like a heartbeat almost. Let me just, one, two, three, four. So that's quite a high beat per minute for a heartbeat. But somebody who might be a little winded. Relaxation. I would say or something of lower physical effort, something like that."
10,12,"This one here is a little harder to distinguish, but I got it. So I would say with this one, here again, it has a high attack and a quick decay. There's a lot of spatial separation between the oscillations, and I would say, maybe even to the extent that I would have a hard time naturally distinguishing this as something that I would pay attention to. I guess, just intuitively, I would be in doubt as to whether this is just something that happens to me by chance or if this is actually something that is directed towards me. I would say somebody who is a little scattered in their life. Things are maybe not so much under control, and they might be living in bursts and then just completely, I don't know, disappear and go away for some time, and then they just come back full force."
10,13,"Okay. This one here feels a little bit more muddy than the other ones, I'd say. In that, the attack, like the onset and the decay, is a little bit weaker than some of the other ones. I would say maybe an engine like a motor that's just running in idle, just standing, being on without actually going anywhere, but just standing there. Or maybe like an old steam train that's just standing there, waiting at the platform ready to go. I would associate it with something that's going in a very uniform pace in the same linear direction. Yes, something that's very syncopated."
10,14,"I would say it feels like dance music almost. It has a really high beat frequency if you can call it that. So like fast-paced music. And also because, again, I would say the onset of this one is a little bit higher. So it's more of the thumping sound that it gives off while still being in a high bpm. This is telling me that something is working at a fast pace. Yes, it's definitely attention-grabbing. I can't really specify what or what kind of feelings it brings with it other than it grabs my attention, not in a bad way or not in a good way. It's a neutral way, I'd say. It feels like something you might be drawn to look towards."
10,15,"So first of all, I would say, again, it feels a little bit more muddy in the sense that the vibration pattern is not as clearly defined or distinctively on-off if you'd say. It's more wavy in that sense. I would say, especially with something like this, where the sensation is so subtle, to begin with, you really have to feel to try to distinguish it. If I had to focus on other things while doing this, I think I would have a hard time allocating enough cognitive energy towards actively distinguishing this pattern here. I would say it makes me feel indifferent, almost. I don't know. It just doesn't really invoke anything special in me as opposed to a lot of the other ones. This one here feels just feels a little bit more indifferent."
10,16,"Okay. I don't really seem to be feeling anything, a little bit, maybe. Let's go with it. I would describe it as maybe a vibrator, almost like it's as opposed to some of the other ones that have this very fast onset and very quick decay as well. This is more of just a quick, vibrating feeling. There's just a continuous vibration. A vibrator. It feels like it's ticklish. Now that I can feel it better, it feels like it travels up the arm. It's a nice sensation actually, very pleasant. It's telling me. I don't know. I don't know if it's telling me anything specifically. It just leaves me with this sensation of pleasantness. I don't really feel that it conveys any message as such other than a purely hedonistic feel of something that feels good. Whereas some of the other examples where I said like this could be a notification, something very sharp that grabs my attention or communicates something's going on. This is more just a static, nice feeling, I would say."
11,1,"I can't feel that much, but initially, when it changed, I think it felt a bit tingly. It's a bit of a tingling sensation that I can feel a little bit on my finger that's not on it as well. It feels a little bit tingly, which is a bit odd and almost like there's something in between my finger and the glass. I don't know, actually. Grainy. I don't think you could describe a person as grainy. Not very different from my normal self. It hasn't really had much of an impact. I don't know."
11,2,"It's really slippery. It feels a lot more slippery. It feels like it's wet. It feels like there's some sort of liquid on the surface. Yes, it's a little bit icy, a little bit odd, because it's like the feeling of it being wet, but then also not cold. It just feels a bit like something's a bit wrong. It does really feel like I have a window that's just been cleaned or something because it's like the feeling of glass, but a bit slippery. You spilled something on a surface. I think I would go with slippery because that's the first thing that came to mind, and that's why it feels like it's easier to move. It feels like my finger is going faster."
11,3,"It's a little bit odd. It's as if there's something on the surface, but I can't feel it. And almost like when you run your hands on a really thin piece of carpet, a carpet that's got lots of stuff in it, not a big, fluffy one, but a boring carpet they put in hospitals and stuff. That's a really hard question. It feels bumpy. It feels like there's something in between. Because it's got this carpet sensation. It feels like it's going to be a bit more static. It's going to be harder to run your fingers across, but it's not. It just feels like there's something in between the glass."
11,4,"That I can't really feel much. This is a lot harder to work out the feeling than the other ones. And I also don't know whether it's just because I've now run my fingers over the same spot. It feels a bit weird. It feels a lot harder, whereas the other one was really slippery. This feels harder for it to run my hand across. I don't know. It doesn't really feel like much. I'm not getting as much of a sensation of this one."
11,5,"I don't know. I also can't feel as much of this one. I can't work out whether it's just doing the same pattern that's making it harder to run your hand from side to side or whether it's actually what it is supposed to be doing. It feels like there's a lot more vibrations and stuff coming from this one. It's a little bit like my phone is in my pocket, and it's vibrating a little bit."
11,6,"This is a bit like perspex glass. It's a little bit plasticky. I don't know if that makes sense. It's almost a bit dryer. It's not very pleasant. I don't particularly like the feeling. It's like when you're unpacking boxes or something. It's got that same sort of sensation. Yes, I'm not that great. It's like if I wouldn't want to voluntarily touch it. I think it would rather just be something that you would run your hands over and go. Take your hands off, or at least I would."
11,7,"It doesn't really feel like much. It just feels like I'm touching a computer screen or something. It's not just the pure glass. It feels a little bit more tactile but not as bad as the perspex-like feeling of the last one when you're running over. Yes, it does remind me of just feeling a phone or something. It's got the same sort of sensation, or at least like a touch screen laptop."
11,8,"This feels a lot lighter for some reason, almost soft in a really weird way. It's not slippery, like the last one, a bit more soft as in a pillow. I feel like it feels like more of material as in something cloth-like than glass, and that is easy. It's more of a gentle sensation. It's quite kind, soft-spoken. There's a lot less friction, or it feels like it than the other ones. And it's quite calming. It feels more like you're painting or something than doing an action."
11,9,"I don't like the feeling of this at all. It feels like your fingers are getting stuck in something like a strange vibration sensation as they get stuck. So it feels like I shouldn't be doing it. As if it was a screen, it would be --. Yes, I guess the sensation is sticky. It's just not particularly pleasant. I don't like the feeling. As you bring your hands across it, it feels like there's little vibrations going into your fingers way more than the other ones. I don't like that. It's a bit uncomfortable. Also, it's slightly reminding me in the pattern that it feels on my fingers of the iPhone alarm. It's got a sequence to it, and you can sort of feel that in your fingers."
11,10,"Okay. This is even worse. That's just like the last one, but just better. It feels like my phone's vibrating, but I've just got my hand on it. I've got a phone call coming through, and it's got one of those annoying ringtones where it's ringing constantly. And there's a vibration setting on. Yes, I mean, all I can think of is a phone because it feels like a vibration. I find that question really hard when you try to feel it. I don't know. Adjectives don't spring to mind. It feels a lot more urgent than the last ones. It feels like I'm supposed to be doing something, and I'm ignoring it."
11,11,"This doesn't feel like much, not really. It doesn't feel like much difference to when it's just the glass. Not really, because I can't really feel much with this one. It's a lot more pleasant than the last. The last ones felt like they were vibrating a lot."
11,12,"It's got an odd sensation. It doesn't feel completely smooth anymore, but a little bit more like your fingers getting stuck. But it's not consistent. It feels a bit like if you've got rubber boots on like rubber Wellies. And you go into someone's house, and you brush your feet, and because there's something about the two materials together, it feels like it's getting stuck. I mean, it's not unpleasant. It just feels like there's something in the way that this makes them stick. My hands are a bit sweatier than they were a few seconds ago, but it doesn't feel like that on my actual hand, just on the glass. As it gets stuck, that's an area that should be paid more attention to. There's a reason why it's getting stuck or at least feels like that like caught rather than stuck, I guess."
11,13,"It feels like there's a pattern to this one, as well as like a vibration but not that it's getting stuck and not like it's ringing either. Not bad because it's quite a familiar feeling rather than a phone ringing. It feels more like there's music playing from the phone, and you can just feel something, but it doesn't feel as intentional. A little bit like a base from a speaker. Consistent."
11,14,"It feels it feels different on each finger. No, I can't associate it with anything that I've felt before. As you're running your finger across it, you hit a point where you can feel it. And it's like vibrations afterward, and then it fades a bit, and then you can feel again. It's almost like you hit the peak of the sensation, and then it fades a little bit. It feels like there's a texture to it. Almost like you're feeling brail. And that it's bumpy. That's maybe a good way of explaining it. It feels like you're running over individual bumps. It got that much texture to it."
11,15,"This one doesn't feel like much. Almost a little bit tingling in my fingers, but other than that, it just feels like glass. I once had a glass screen protector that gave a similar sensation, but I think it just wasn't put on properly. It's quite a nice sensation. It doesn't feel sticky or uncomfortable. You've just touched something that is a little bit static, but you've not had a static shock. It just feels a bit like static."
11,16,"I can't really feel much. No, not really. Just a little bit rough. It's almost like a piece of wood that's just being sanded, so it should be smooth, but it's a little bit not, a little bit more textured than just a smooth piece of wood. It does feel like it doesn't normally feel like this. It feels like this for a reason. It's hardy, a bit rough around the edges. It does remind me of the feeling of sandpaper. It reminds me of my granddad building stuff. It's got the same sort of sensation as a piece of wood or a drawer or something like that."
12,1,"On this finger, I can feel tiny little, very light bumps, but super, super light. Not bringing up many feelings, more annoyance that I can't feel it, but I think I've got quite calloused fingers. It's weird that I can't feel it on those two. Feels like a stubbly beard, but like the day after shaving."
12,2,"Yes, nothing on those two fingers again. It almost feels like it's not as continuous as the last one. The last one was like tiny little footsteps. This is more of like a skip. Like a very faint heartbeat, if you were testing somebody. Quiet because I can barely feel it. Yes, just like a mousy person that doesn't really have much to say, but a child, definitely a child. A quiet child that is skipping around a playground."
12,3,"I think this one is even fainter than the first two. It is so hard to know whether it's the screen or --. Don't really feel like I'm feeling anything. There might be a slight buzz. The first one was like somebody who's doing tiny steps. The second one was like skipping. This is even more continuous than steps like a razor or something, but super, super light because I'm not even sure if I'm really feeling anything. Not much, because I can't feel it. Nothing, I think. I would be trying to make something up here because I am really not feeling much."
12,4,"What's wrong with my fingers? Again, absolutely nothing that time. No."
12,5,"Once again, I don't think I feel anything on any of the fingers. Maybe like a very light vibration on my pinkie, but I could be imagining it because I want to."
12,6,"Nothing on the first or second. Maybe I feel something super, super light again. Feels like running my finger over glass, but with a little bit more friction, I guess, like little tiny bumps. There is tiny, tiny, not even sand, smaller than sand on it, possibly. Yes, reminds me of running your finger through sand for some reason."
12,7,"Nothing on the first finger. This one is super light again. Is there maybe pulses that are far apart? They're not really just one wide gap between each pulse, I think, but super light, quite hard to detect. Certainly not on my first two fingers, but I'm getting something maybe on my third and on my pinky. Nonexistent, it really doesn't feel like it's there. I guess I used this analogy already, but like a very slow heartbeat like [onomatopoeia] with little tiny vibration on it. [onomatopoeia]. Maybe it's a dying bee. Sad."
12,8,"Nothing on the first. Nothing on the second. No, I don't think I'm getting anything at all this time. No, I've got nothing to say on that. It's nothing there."
12,9,"Okay, it seems I've got a numb first finger because there's nothing happening there. Not much going on with the second. No, I don't think I'm really getting anything."
12,10,"No, not much going on with first or second. No. Feels like maybe there is a very, very light, similar to one of the ones from the first half, like very continuous buzz, but very very light once again. Or is it continuous? Yes, not much happening there but just very, very light buzz. "
12,11,"Nothing on my first finger. Nothing on second. No, I don't think I'm getting anything again. It's less continuous than the last one, a little bit bumpy, but super, super light once again. Yes, not much to say on it because I can barely feel it. A little bit gravelly."
12,12,"Nothing on first. Nothing on second. Feels like this one is maybe like another pulsing one, perhaps. It's like [onomatopoeia] but once again super light, can't really feel it. I don't know. I don't love it for some reason. It doesn't feel super good. I can definitely feel it a bit more now that I'm touching it more. Yes, it's grand. I wouldn't be annoyed if this was on my phone. I don't know if I'd feel it if it was on my phone. I would describe it as a gentle buzz, pulsing, that goes on and off and on and off, and it's not continuous."
12,13,"Okay, I'm getting this on my pinky for sure. It feels like going over speed bumps. If you were an ant --. That doesn't make any sense. Not a normal person's speed bump --. An ant going over ant-sized speed bumps. Not us going over us-sized speed bumps for some reason. It's very, very small the sensation, but it is bumpy. I like it more than the last one. I didn't love the gaps in the last one. The gaps made me uncomfortable for some reason. It feels like it's bumpy, so I guess there is technically gaps, but obviously, they're closer together. Yes, I could vibe with this one. Yes, but I don't know what. It's really hard to recall sensations. Do you know whenever you start getting your blood taken, and you can feel your blood in your finger? You've got that little thing that clips on. It feels like that. But it doesn't feel like taking someone's heartbeat. I don't know. "
12,14,"Okay, nothing there on the first finger. Nothing on second. So hard to tell the difference between the glass and the sensations. Yes, getting something on my pinky finger. This feels definitely more intense than the last one. Is it like a longer one and then a shorter one or something? Feels like that. Or is it just one? [onomatopoeia]. Yes, this one's okay. It feels like there's more manic. There's more beats in it. Do you know whenever you're playing Xbox or Playstation, and you crash into something, or somebody shoots you, it vibrates? Feels like that. It's telling me that I've just been shot or that I've crashed into something. I'm associating it with that memory."
12,15,"Nothing on my first finger. Nothing on second. Nothing on third. Okay, definitely getting something super light. Feels like there's big gaps between it. Only when I change direction, maybe it does something. Feels super light. This feels like a very chilled-out one. Like you're taking a stroll on the beach. I don't know what vibrates on a beach. Your phone vibrates in your pocket or something like relax; we're having a good time.  Somebody that is a bit of a stoner and is giving deep thoughts for some reason. I don't know why. But it just feels like a chill-out, like whatever, we're just hanging out. Just chilled out, having a good time."
12,16,"Maybe something on the first two. Yes, there's my pinky picking something up. Definitely got something. I don't like this one. Why? It feels uneven. The vibrations just aren't equal to each other, and that just doesn't feel good. It's more intense than the others, but not in a nice way. Nothing springing to mind. I'm not having a good time, I would say. Bad. I'm not sad. I'm not angry. What's a bad emotion? Annoyance; get yourself together. Why are you so on even? Yes, someone who is sloppy, messy. I'm annoyed at you. And you're making me uncomfortable."
